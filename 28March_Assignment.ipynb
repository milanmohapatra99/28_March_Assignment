    "**Ridge regression** is a regularized linear regression model that is used to prevent overfitting. It does this by adding a penalty term to the cost function that penalizes the magnitude of the coefficients. This encourages the model to learn smaller coefficients, which makes the model less complex and more generalizable to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ordinary least squares (OLS)** regression is a linear regression model that minimizes the sum of squared residuals. This means that it tries to find the line that best fits the data in the least-squares sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Differences between ridge regression and OLS regression:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ridge regression penalizes the magnitude of the coefficients, while OLS regression does not.\n",
    "* Ridge regression is more robust to overfitting than OLS regression.\n",
    "* Ridge regression is more computationally expensive to train than OLS regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use ridge regression:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* When you have a large number of features and you want to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "* When you have outliers in your data.\n",
    "* When you want to build a model that is simple and interpretable.\n",

    "**When to use OLS regression:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* When you have a small number of features and you are not concerned about overfitting.\n",
    "* When you do not have outliers in your data.\n",
    "* When you want to build a model that is as accurate as possible, even if it is more complex and less interpretable.\n",

    "Suppose we are building a model to predict house prices based on a number of features, such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and location. We have a large number of features, and we know that some of the features are highly correlated. We also have some outliers in our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we train an OLS regression model on this data, the model may overfit to the training data. This is because the model will learn to fit the noise in the data as well as the underlying patterns.\n",

    "We can use ridge regression to prevent the model from overfitting. By adding a penalty term to the cost function, ridge regression will encourage the model to learn smaller coefficients. This will make the model less complex and more generalizable to unseen data.\n",

The value of lambda that produces the lowest average cross-validation error is selected as the best value.\n",
